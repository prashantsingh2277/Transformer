Custom Transformer Model: Built a Transformer model from scratch for sequence-to-sequence tasks using PyTorch. The model includes an encoder-decoder architecture with multi-head self-attention, positional embeddings, and feed-forward layers to process input and output sequences efficiently.

Scalable Design: Configured the model with tunable hyperparameters such as embedding size, number of attention heads, and number of layers, making it adaptable for various sequence lengths and complexities. Implemented layer normalization and dropout to improve generalization.

Training and Optimization: Trained the model using a learning rate scheduler, gradient clipping, and mixed-precision training to handle large datasets while minimizing memory usage.

Application: The model was applied to generate and classify text sequences, ensuring high performance with a balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.
